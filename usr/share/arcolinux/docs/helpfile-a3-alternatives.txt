"Bunsen Alternatives"
=====================
The "Bunsen Alternatives" are four groups added to the Debian Alternatives:

        bl-file-manager
        bl-text-editor
        bl-image-viewer
        bl-media-player

They can be used in menus, keyboard shortcuts, config files and scripts
just like any other command, and will call up whatever application has been
set as that alternative. Often the setting will be done automatically, but
even done manually it only needs to be done once to cover
all the calls to that command. (See "Editing Alternatives" below.)

The default settings in a new install of BunsenLabs are:

        bl-file-manager Thunar
        bl-text-editor  Geany
        bl-image-viewer Mirage
        bl-media-player VLC

The only difference from the other Debian alternatives is that they are
not automatically added by packages themselves.
For example, when xfce4-terminal is installed, it will add itself to the
available options for x-terminal-emulator. However, even though pcmanfm is
a possible alternative for bl-file-manager the pcmanfm package will not add
itself to that alternatives group. That job is done by the bl-alternatives
script which is called automatically by dpkg after each package install.
(It is very fast and does not significantly slow down the install.)

The applications which can be added by bl-alternatives are:
        bl-file-manager: thunar caja nautilus pcmanfm spacefm xfe
        bl-text-editor: geany emacs gedit jedit kate leafpad medit mousepad scite
        bl-image-viewer: mirage eog eom gpicview viewnior
        bl-media-player: vlc banshee dragonplayer gnome-mplayer gxine kaffeine parole smplayer totem

Note: gvim is also an option for bl-text-editor, but
 is handled specially (wrapper and man page names differ).

You can change these by editing /usr/bin/bl-alternatives,
or add an app to an alternative group manually (see below).

Editing Alternatives
====================
You can edit any Debian Alternatives (including the bl-* BunsenLabs varieties)
with the command 'update-alternatives' (see 'man update-alternatives'), but
there is also a graphic front end called Galternatives which is easier to
use in some ways.

In the BunsenLabs menu, click "System" > "Edit Debian Alternatives".
You can scroll down the list to see what alternative groups have been
installed on your system, what options are available for each group
and if there is more than one option you can set a different one.

You can also add a new application to an existing alternative group,
so if the bl-alternatives script has failed to add your favourite
image viewer to bl-image-viewer you can add it manually here.

It is not possible to remove a whole group with galternatives,
but you can remove an individual option from some group.

NOTE: These settings are system-wide, affecting all users.
If you want a local version of bl-file-manager set to eg spacefm,
while leaving the system setting unchanged, then put a symbolic link
called 'bl-file-manager' in ~/bin which points to /usr/bin/spacefm.
If ~/bin is in your $PATH and comes before /usr/bin then your symlink
will override the system bl-file-manager.

See 'man update-alternatives' for details of the Debian Alternatives.
